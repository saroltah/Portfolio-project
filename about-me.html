              I was born in Hungary, and I have worked most of my life as a
              pre-shool teacher. I am proud of my creative side, that I have
              been showing in different art-works, paintings and
              marker-drawings.
              <br />
              I am pretty adventuorus, so I have lived in Spain, Sweden and
              Denmark also. I would like to encurage everyone to discover the
              world, it might seems scary first, but gives experience of a
              lifetime. That is why I chose to peresnt my cities.
              <br />
              I have always been interested in coding, and I am glad I stepped
              out for this carreer change, I enjoy it very much and I am really
              excited about what the future holds.
